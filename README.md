# Imperative Programming - Hillary Term  
*Part of my undergraduate CS + Philosophy degree at Oxford University*

## Naming Conventions and Structures  

For the course, the structure under **`Psets/`** is organized as follows:

- Each directory **`p set <n>`** will contain the problem set for **week (n+1)**.
- Inside each **`p set <n>`** directory:
  - There will be a separate file for each problem.
  - Additionally, there will be a general **Markdown file** for my notes, observations, and reflections.  

### Problem File Naming Convention  

Each problem file is named **`qu<i>`** followed by a number of asterisks (**`*`**) that indicate the importance or discussion priority for that question:  

- **`qu<i>`**  
  - No asterisks (0 `*`):  
    - I am comfortable skipping this question during the tutorial.
  - **`qu<i>*`** (1 asterisk):  
    - There is something I want to discuss about this question.  
  - **`qu<i>**`** (2 asterisks):  
    - There is a lot I want to discuss.  
  - More asterisks (e.g., **`qu<i>***`**, **`qu<i>****`**):  
    - Signify increased time spent on the problem and/or significant interest due to complexity or insights.
   
### Commmit History

This is currently a mess, but starting from pset2 I will try  to make my commit history reflect my thought process as I am going through the working sheet.

### coming soon
make just one md file for each pset so its easier to mark
