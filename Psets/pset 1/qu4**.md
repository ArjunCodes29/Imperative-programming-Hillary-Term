## No comments
    Should have some comments explaining the code. At the minimum we woudl want a post comment stating that findSum
    finds the sum of an array.

    You could have comments that spell out Invariants but this is fine to ignore I think.
    
## Assuming args can be converted using toInt
    I mean this is a fair assumption I think, but yeah maybe want to handle cases where someone says something like 
    ["one", "four", etc.]

## for loop is not ideal
    In this course we use while's because they are easier to prove things about. Switch up the for loop to a while loop.

## variable naming can be better
    "n" doesnt actually have any meaning, neither does "a" instead it might be nice to say things like "arraySize" or "array"

## in actuality the code is pretty nice
    I was nitpicking, I think the code is quite decently written. I wonder what mistakes you were looking for?
